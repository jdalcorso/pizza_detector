Got dataset of pizza images, got idea of pizza ingredients classification

31/10/20
A first model over the pizza dataset is computed.
13 binary classifiers are created, one for every ingredient, using HOG/SGD.

xx/11/20
Keras is discovered 

Idea to turn the 13 models into one single model (multilabel classification)
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/07/multi-label-classification-with-keras/
https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-label-classification-with-deep-learning/
The 2 main results about multilabel classification on Google are used.

VGG Keras network implemented, poor results

Personal CNN implemented, poor results.
https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1?gi=8d656171a4d9

Transfer learning and fine-tuning discovered.
The idea is now to find the best Keras-provided net. 
Switched approach from Keras.sequential to Keras.functional

Resnet50 is implemented, then Resnet18. Poor results probably due to a lack of personal effort.
Personal effort obtained: InceptionV3 studied and implemented for multilabel classification.

Reduced labels from 13 to 7, some ingredients almost never appear in the dataset.
Reduced dataset from 9213 to 8045 deleting images with deleted ingredients.

Train with GPU: task failed. Need to split the training in order to not overheat the Mac.

Switched to imagenet weights (InceptionV3), better results.
>50% accuracy over the dataset achieved. Good classification results obtained over personal pizza images.

Streamlit UI is created. Streamlit Share account is created.
UI creation is way easier than model training.

02/01/21
>52% accuracy obtained. Plan to train 10 epochs then stop.
Results are good

03/01/21
pipreqs used to write requirements. Plan to put the whole on Github 

04/01/21
Issues on requirements and packages for deployment on Streamlit share (Googled)
Can now load weights instead of the whole model (only inference instead of training)
Deployment on streamlit share.

Webapp works fine on Streamlit Share

Completed documentation of the code
Completed .pdf summary of the project
